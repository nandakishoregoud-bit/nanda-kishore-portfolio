    <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
    <p>
        Hi, I'm <strong>Yesu VV Nanda Kishore Goud</strong>, a passionate and driven software developer with a strong background in

        that enhance user experiences.
    </p>

    <p>
        My journey in software development began with a curiosity to understand how technology shapes our world.
        Over the years, I have worked on a variety of projects, ranging from web applications and mobile apps 
        to backend systems that handle complex data operations. 
        I am always eager to learn new technologies, refine my skills, and build products that solve real-world problems.
